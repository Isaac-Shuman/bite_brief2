# Welcome to BiteBrief!

**Hello, Dear User!** ðŸŽ‰

Welcome to the underbelly of our wondeful project BiteBrief. I am very happy to intorduce you to our work and guide you through getting started.
First, let me tell you a bit about our project.

## Project description

BiteBrief is a web service that helps users like yourself get notified about their favourite meals on the UCLA campus and maybe more when the time comes. Not only that, but our werservice can help you expand a user's dining experience by customizing a daily meal plan for them. A user can choose their diet, favourite dishes and allergies and get an email with a personalised daily meal plan option based on their preferences. On top of that we also collect data about allergies and their severities for each user and then are providing it to dining halls to make them aware of how they can modify the menu in the future to avoid triggering certain allergies. That said, we also have something fun: we choose a random user to display on the Home page and 1 fun fact that they wrote about themselves; this feature creates a sense of community among users and encourages users to often visit the home page in hopes of seeing their name!

## How to run this app

### Preparation

Now let's jump back to the serious stuff: how to make this app run on your local machine.
1. Install mySQL
2. Install node.js so that you can run "node server.js" later on
3. Make a mySQL database:
    If you're on Linux or WSL, run: usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql -u root -e "CREATE DATABASE IF 
    NOT EXISTS default_db" -p
    If you're on Windows, you can use mySQL Workbench or a VSCode extention.
    Yyou have a lot of flexibility with where the database is located.
4. Update the initialize function server.js to your username, password, and database name.
   This is the little snippet of the code from the server.js file where you need to enter your credentials:
   const connection = await mysql.createConnection({
    host: "localhost",
    user: "---",
    password: "---",
    database: "---", //usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql -u root -e "CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS default_db" -p
    multipleStatements: false, //not protected against sql injections, but meh Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
  });

### Running this App

1. Run "npm install" to install the dependencies for the app such as axios and express.
2. Run "node server.js" to start the backend server. If this works without throwing an error then it means you did the database part right.
3. Run "npm start" IN A SEPARATE TERMINAL to start the react app. The website should now be visible in port 3000 and should be loading in data from the server on the rankings page.
4. Google login is configured to only work on localhost and localhost:3000.

The navbar may not be fully visible if your window is not maximized.

The database backend was modeled after the examples on the mySQL2 API documentation https://sidorares.github.io/node-mysql2/docs/examples/queries/simple-queries

Google login was modeled after https://blog.logrocket.com/guide-adding-google-login-react-app/
