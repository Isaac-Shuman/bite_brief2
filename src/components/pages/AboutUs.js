      <br></br>
      <p>As a UCLA student living on campus you’re faced with a myriad of dining halls, takeout restaurants, and food trucks to select from for each and every meal of the day. For each of these eateries, you have your favorites–dishes that can instantly decide your plan when they are offered: the eggs and hashbrowns from De Neve, the albacore tuna salad from Bruin Plate, and the chicken fettuccine alfredo from Epicuria. But when you're busy writing Bash scripts to grep for process ids, it can be a pain to manually grep every menu for these items. 
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      <p>BiteBrief is a web app rolling over the cusp of inception to development to come and fix this problem. With its expansive database of every dish from every eatery shown on https://menu.dining.ucla.edu/Menus/, BiteBrief will notify you when your dealmaker dishes for each restaurant are being offered.
